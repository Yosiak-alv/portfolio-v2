                            Hello, iâ€™m Josias!
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            I have the ambition to develop professionally in the field of web development, 
                            being an active part of a company where I can contribute significantly to their projects. 
                            My main goal is to start my career as a Back-End Developer, with the desire to apply my 
                            acquired knowledge and eventually evolve into a Full Stack Developer profile.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Currently, I am developing independent projects involving technologies such as 
                            SQL, Laravel, Inertia.js, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Vue.js amoung others.
                        </p>
